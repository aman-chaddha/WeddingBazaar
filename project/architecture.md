# WeddingBazaar â€“ Architecture & Database Design

## System Architecture (High-Level)
- Frontend: React (Vite) in `client/web/` using Redux Toolkit and React Router.
- Backend: FastAPI in `server/` with REST APIs, Pydantic schemas, and JWT-based auth.
- DB: PostgreSQL (managed via SQLAlchemy + Alembic). Admin via pgAdmin.
- Caching/Queues (optional for MVP): Redis + Celery for background tasks (emails, notifications, file processing).
- Storage: Local or S3-compatible object storage for media uploads.
- Payments: Stripe (escrow-like flows modeled at application layer).
- Notifications: Email (FastAPI-Mail) and in-app notifications.

## Services & Components
- API Gateway (FastAPI app): routing, auth, validation, rate limiting (future).
- Auth Service: registration, login, token management, roles & permissions.
- Vendor Service: vendor profiles, services, pricing, availability, portfolios.
- Package Service: generation, iteration tracking, itemized inclusions, budgets.
- Booking & Payment Service: bookings, invoices, payment intents, escrow holds, payouts.
- Event Management Service: sub-events, timelines, tasks, checklists, status updates.
- Guest Management: guest lists, RSVPs, seating, accommodations.
- Messaging: in-app chat between couples and vendors.
- Reviews & Ratings: post-event vendor feedback.

## Environment Variables (Backend)
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
- `SECRET_KEY=...`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60`
- `STRIPE_API_KEY=...`
- `MAIL_USERNAME=...`
- `MAIL_PASSWORD=...`
- `MAIL_FROM=...`
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0` (optional)

## Indices & Constraints (examples)
- Unique: `users.email`, `users.phone` (optional), `vendors.user_id`, `couples.user_id`.
- Indices on foreign keys: `vendor_services.vendor_id`, `package_items.package_id`, `payments.booking_id`, etc.
- Check constraints (business rules): `packages.iteration_count <= 5`, `rating between 1 and 5`.

## ERD (Textual Overview)
- One `user` can be a `couple`, `family_member`, `vendor`, or `admin` (role-based).
- A `couple` has many `packages`; a `package` has many `package_items` and `vendor_shortlists`.
- A `booking` is tied to one accepted `package`; it has many `payments` and `events`.
- `events` have `event_tasks`, `vendor_status_updates`, and guest `rsvps`/`seating`.
- `vendors` offer `vendor_services` with `service_media`; receive `reviews` from couples.
- Messaging and notifications connect users across flows.

## Migration Strategy
- Use Alembic for versioned migrations.
- Seed reference data (service categories) via migration or fixtures.
- Backfill and evolve schema per feature flags and phases.
